### The Problem

The advent of affordable tools for home recording over the last 20 years has made music creation more accessible than ever before. Simultaneously, social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook have made it similarly cheap and easy to advertise yourself to a targeted audience. However, most budding musicians, and even seasoned industry veterans, don't always know the best way to reach new fans; the *how*, *who*, and *where* questions always loom tall when it's time for a new release.

**In this study, I intend to create a recommender system to show similarities between the music of a new artist and that of popular artists around the globe, in order to generate basic recommendations to best connect new artists with new fans. I'll base this model on data from hundreds of thousands of songs hosted on the popular streaming platform Spotify, along with metrics I'll extract from a new artist's music using a Python library called Librosa.**
